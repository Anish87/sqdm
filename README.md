# SqDM
SqDM is a sample server built using SqMod for VC:MP.

I created this just for a sample for those who wanna use SqMod for their servers but don't know how and where to start.
The scripts are highly categorised into events, classses, commands and miscellaneous scripts. I have used the normal Squirrel style to write the scripts to make it really simple for whoever tries SqMod for the first time. I have attached the plugins along with the scripts so that there's no issue later on.
Whoever uses this, or reviews it, please let me know in case of **major** bugs, I'll fix ASAP.

Refer to the SqMod wiki to understand the functions and events.
