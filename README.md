# SqDM
SqDM is a sample server built using SqMod for VC:MP.

I created this just for a sample for those who wanna use SqMod for their servers but don't know how and where to start.
The scripts are highly categorised into events, classses, commands and miscellaneous scripts. I have used the normal Squirrel style to write the scripts to make it really simple for whoever tries SqMod for the first time.
Whoever uses this, or reviews it, please let me know in case of **major** bugs, I'll fix ASAP.

Refer to the SqMod wiki to understand the functions and events.
